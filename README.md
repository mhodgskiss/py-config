# Klein Config

Module to provide config management

## Usage

```python
from klein_config import get_config

# Can be overriden with env variable MY_CONFIG_SETTING
config = get_config({"my": {"config": {"setting": "initialised value"}})

# Access via `get` accessor with no backup (raises ConfigMissingException if not found).
value = config.get("my.config.setting")

# Access via `get` accessor method with a backup.
backup_value = config.get("not.a.setting", "backup value")

# Access via `dict` (raises KeyError if not found).
same_value = config["my.config.setting"]

# Sub-configs are created if the value is another `dict`.
intermediate_config = config["my.config"]
same_value_again = intermediate_config["setting"]
```

### Structure
Internally the config object uses the ConfigTree structure that is part of pyhocon. This can be traversed easily with the get method using dot notation as outlined above.

### Config Initialisation
The `get_config` function looks for :
- argument `--common` or environmental variable `PY_ENV_AWARE_COMMON` to specify a valid filepath for a common config file (in either JSON or YAML format); and
- argument `--config` or environmental variable `PY_ENV_AWARE_CONFIG` to specify a valid filepath for a config file 


N.B. Passing both environmental variables _and_ arguments for either config or common is ambiguous and is therefore NOT accepted.

You can also pass a `dict` into the `get_config` function.

#### Example configs
JSON:
```json
{
  "rabbitmq": {
    "host": [
      "localhost"
    ],
    "port": 5672,
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password"
  },
  "mongo": {
    "host": [
      "mongo.domain.com"
    ],
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```
YAML:
```yaml
mongo:
  host:
    - mongo.domain.com
  password: password
  username: username
rabbitmq:
  host:
    - localhost
  password: username
  port: 5672
  username: password
```

Example config files are also provided in [json](example.config.json) and [yaml](example.config.yaml) formats.

### Order precedence
The configs are applied to the config object in the following order: 

1. Common config as identified via argument `--common` or environmental variable `PY_ENV_AWARE_COMMON`
2. Config that is injected via the Class constructor
3. Config that is identified via the argument `--config` or environmental variable `PY_ENV_AWARE_CONFIG`


Configs will override any previous values as they are applied.

### Environment Aware
The module is "Environment Aware", i.e. it will look for envrionment variables in the first instance. If a valid variable exists then this will be used regardless of any config that may have been supplied.

The path is transformed by converting the string to uppercase and replacing all dots with underscores.

```
my.config.setting => MY_CONFIG_SETTING
```

Sub-config items are still overriden by the same environment variables as in the root config.

## Development
This project uses [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). To install it, run `pip install pipenv`.

### Development
```
pipenv install --dev
```

### Testing
```bash
pipenv run python -m pytest
```
For test coverage you can run:
```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv run python -m pytest --cov-report term --cov src/ tests/
```

### Troubleshooting

If you are unable to run `pipenv shell` and are having permission errors, you can spin up a virtual environment in which to run 
the `pipenv` commands:

```bash
pip install virtualenv      // install virtualenv module
virtual env venv            // create your virtual environment (run command from project root directory)
source venv/bin/activate    // start the virtual environment
pipenv install --dev        // install dependencies - you should now be able to run the tests with the above commands
```
